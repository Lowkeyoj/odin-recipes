        <li>Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, 
          and salt together in a large bowl</li>

          vanilla extract together until combined
          .Pour into dry ingredients and mix 
          everything together with a rubber 
          spatula until completely combined
          .Fold in the white chocolate chips and 
          macadamia nuts.(You can use a mixer 
          for this step if needed.)</li>
          
        <li>Cover and chill the dough in the 
          refrigerator for at least 2 hours and 
          up to 4 days.If chilling for longer 
          than 2 hours, allow to sit at room 
          temperature for at least 20-30 minutes 
          before rolling and baking because the 
          dough will be quite hard.</li>
          
        <li>Preheat oven 350 degrees F.Line 
          baking sheets with parchment paper 
          or silicone baking mats.Set aside. </li>

          1-1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie,

          sheets. Bake for 12-13 minutes or until 
          lightly browned on the sides. The centers 
          will look soft</li>
          
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow cookies 
          to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes 
          before transferring to a wire rack to 
          cool completely </li>
